                    <h2>What Personal Data We Collect and Why</h2>
        
                    <h3>Comments</h3>
                    <p>When visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, along with the
                        visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string. This information helps us identify and respond to
                        comments effectively, as well as prevent spam.</p>
                    <p>An anonymized hash created from your email address might be provided to the Gravatar service to check if
                        you use it. Review the Gravatar service privacy policy for details. After your comment is approved, your
                        profile picture becomes visible to the public alongside your comment.</p>
        
                    <h3>Media</h3>
                    <p>If you upload images to the website, please be aware that including embedded location data (EXIF GPS) in

                    <p>When you interact with our site, certain information is stored in cookies to enhance your browsing
                        experience. For example, if you leave a comment on our site, you can opt to save your name, email
                        address, and website in cookies for convenience. These cookies last for one year. If you have an account
                        and log in, temporary cookies are used to maintain your login status. These cookies are discarded upon
                        closing your browser.</p>

                        websites. Embedded content from other websites behaves in the same way as if the visitor visited those
                        websites directly. These websites may collect data, use cookies, embed third-party tracking, and monitor
                        interactions with embedded content, including when logged in to their website.</p>
